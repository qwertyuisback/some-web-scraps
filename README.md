Here are some scraping codes I did via Selenium.

UPD 20/10/2024: I added a code that I also use personally to scrap some video links of Youtube playlists I created to save them as txt files too. I also put an example txt files to show the result of the code. [Scraping youtube playlist video names and links]

UPD 01/07/2024: I added a simple scraping code in a small page [scraping_in_a_small_page]
